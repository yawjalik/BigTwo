# BigTwo
## BigTwo game made with Java Swing
---
Project made as part of a Java/OOP course. Some of the classes were provided and not written by me.

### How to use:
1. clone this repo
2. compile BigTwoServer.java and start the server by running BigTwoServer
3. compile BigTwo and start a client by running BigTwo
4. game requires 4 players to run so four client instances have to be created

### Some cool features:
1. Omori themed GUI made with swing components
2. Networking capabilities (although currently hardcoded to localhost)
